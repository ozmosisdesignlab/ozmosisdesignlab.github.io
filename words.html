					<h1 class="chapters chapterone" id="chapterone">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
						
						<p class="initialchar"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OZMOSIS</span> 
						is a phonetic reimagining of the word osmosis, which is the tendency of fluid, typically water, to pass through a semipermeable membrane into a solution where the solvent concentration is higher, thus equalizing the concentration of any given substance on either side of the membrane. 
						That is to say, it serves to diffuse fluids over a porous barrier in a gradual absorption process that culminates in a state of equilibrium.
						<br>
						<br>
						Whew.
						<br>
						<br>
						<mark class="one">Ozmosis is a nickname</mark> I was given by a coworker, once upon a time. Probably because, as Bruce Lee once said, <mark class="one">"...Water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend,"</mark> and I'm okay with that balance.
						It certainly beats having your last name mangled by overthinking. So, I made it into a logo for this website.
						<br>
						<br>
						Now, with that out of the way, let's talk shop.
						</p>
						
						<p class="initialchar">Zanzibar.... Some day, you really must go. Not that I've been, but Mombasa is <i>just</i> above it, and I probably threw a stone away while I was there. 
						Now, look at that! I've got the two initial letters of this website capitalized, for eye-candy and general thematic purposes, with what they (in the book publishing industry) call "drop caps." 
						Really, no cap &mdash; ugh, I'll spare my millenial upbringing from any more appropriation, but puns are kind of my hill to perish on. 
						Am I going to need to drop cap OZ for every future paragraph, on every page? No, but this page will serve as the one with a shameless plug.
						<br>
						<br>
						You're welcome. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span>Anyway, <mark class="three">I'm pretty sure I made my first website when I was around 6 years old.</mark> Ah, those were the days... when your kindergarten's guitar teacher sunlighted as a web dev, yet you never took their guitar class so that's all you knew them by. 
						Back then, all you needed was a notepad program, a little <span class="plaincode">&lt;html&gt;</span> <span class="plaincode">&lt;head&gt;</span> <span class="plaincode">&lt;body&gt;</span> <span class="plaincode">&lt;p&gt;</span> (maybe a <span class="plaincode">&lt;footer&gt;</span> if you remembered), and you were in business. 
						Don't get me wrong. I'm sure that website looked just about the same as the notepad html it was written on: lots of white space, maybe a bold heading, and a sentence.
						Sadly, but really thankfully, times have changed. Now you can do that same thing on Notepad++ (what I use), or something more robust like VS Code, with the addition of <span class="plaincode">&lt;main&gt;</span> <span class="plaincode">&lt;section&gt;</span> <span class="plaincode">&lt;article&gt;</span> etc., yet I still have that <s>innovative</s> design aesthetic, so I guess not that much has changed.
						As far as experience goes though, <mark class="two">I'm self-taught regarding HTML, CSS, Javascript, and art in general.</mark> Sure, I've had the odd grade school class on art, but nothing about proper techniques or materials.
						Digital art became more natural as a result, what with its great compatibility with web design, and the fact that it requires no physical materials or mess, which take up space and preparation time.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span><mark class="two">When I first set out to make this website, I had very little idea of what I would do.</mark> The haunting websites of the 90's and 2000's still brought bittersweet memories of bland and bleak colors with gray drop-down menus... what was not to love?
						A lot has changed since those landing pages doubled as historic landmarks of the burgeoning digital age, and as business websites, somehow made to engender sales and customer sentiment.
						Of course, the internet was young and full of hope back then, when so few websites graced the halls of glory-ensconced web traffic and pageviews; any website was worth viewing, merely for the reason of it existing at all.
						But now, in this modern day and age, there are so many websites out there that creating one is but a drop in the proverbial bucket of water &mdash; or, dare I say, bucket of AI slop. 
						<mark class="three">Anyone can AI prompt their way into a fully fledged website, now.</mark> But, like the reckless pioneers of olden times, <mark class="one">I chose not to,</mark> and instead heeded the call of the wild <mark class="one">as a means of pursuing the fundamentals.</mark>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span>Funnily, I just read an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/magazine/chatgpt-dash-hyphen-writing-communication.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article in the New York Times about AI overusing the late, great em dash</a> &mdash; and I love me some em dash &mdash; how it was a tell-tale sign of AI use in writing. 
						(If you'd like to read that NYT article, well, buckle up Bilbo, because you're going to go there and back again once you hit the paywall to view.)
						I guess the thinking was that AI had trained on all the old-timey novels with heavy use of the em dash and was now regurgitating that style of writing onto the sensitive stomachs of young, avid readers, people clearly incapable of having read anything with such an &mdash; well &mdash; unused mode of punctuation in text messages. 
						Personally, I like my em dashes right up on the money&mdash;likeso&mdash;but it doesn't look as good on a website, nor is it fun to type with the code so close to the nearly indistinguishable words. 
						Of course, not too long after, OpenAI allowed you to disable ChatGPT from using the &mdash; which you can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/forget-agi-sam-altman-celebrates-chatgpt-finally-following-em-dash-formatting-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read at Ars Technica.</a>
						Sigh. The point is, read any book, just any. There are already signs of the waning em dash &mdash; where art thou, oh Romeo of writing. 
						And let us not forget the colon/comma chimera, the semi-colon; to be, or not to be, without the very first hybrid worker in the punctual office space of words &mdash; but I digress.					
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"><mark class="three">To go some way towards combatting the veritable tsunami of new sites splashing across the internet, </mark></span> giving new meaning to the great, American pastime of surfing, here I have created this website solely derived from some graphical planning and a bit of experimental meandering.
						Each page was built, one at a time, with OK code and some visual acumen to spice things up with nifty animations and bold partitions between writing and images.
						To begin working on this display, <mark class="two">I first drew what I wanted in a vectorized playing field of shapes, colors, and text. </mark>
						</p>

					<h1 class="chapters chaptertwo" id="chaptertwo">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
					
						<p class="initialchar">More drop caps, and more to say on this page of "words," describing a bit of the process behind creating this website.
						As alluded to at the end of Chapter One, <mark class="four">I first came up with the design using a vector graphics program called Inkscape. </mark>
						Inkscape is a free program, and while it may not have as many of the more complex features of Adobe Illustrator, it gets the job done.
						What it lacks in AI processing gimmicks, it readily makes up for in light-weight, straightforward graphical rendering in my favorite format &mdash; SVG.
						<mark class="five">Why do I like SVG? Well, to the uninitiated, SVG files contain graphics that are based on vector shapes that are inherently scalable; </mark>the computer does math to create a representation of a shape. 
						At this point, the shape is not made of pixels, but virtually infinite "dimensions," i.e. vectors. This differs drastically from a rasterized image, one found in typical file formats like JPG (or JPEG), PNG, possibly PDF, or TIFF.
						There are more file formats beyond that, but those are the most common for raster images, also commonly referred to as bitmap images.
						Basically, one uses math and the other uses the literal RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) of your computer's screen to digitize a visual into a displayable image through pixels.
						<mark class="six">I used vector graphics for logos and distinctive iconography with limited gradients and blending. Otherwise, raster images or bitmaps were used for pixel smudging, shading, and more nuanced color mixing, as in digital paintings and other complexly hued art.</mark>
						<br>
						<br>
						Easy peasy, right?
						<br>
						<br>
						Okay, enough of the boring stuff.
						</p>
						<p class="initialchar">Ordinarily, I'd just write up an html document, run it in a browser, and call it a day. 
						But this time around, since I wanted to share this website with others (rather than have it waft in the ambiance of my SSD graveyard), I came up with a plan.
						Cue the montage of highlighter markers popping open, a big sketch pad slapping down on an desk so inclined to hold it, and watch as an elbow braces against the page while a hand guides a marker along a straight-lined path.
						Now, with that image in mind, forget about it. <mark class="six">I just used Inkscape, like a sane person, and moused out shapes and pushed around some node points to make a logo. </mark>
						Seriously though, I'm probably one of the few people that doesn't use an EMR pen or a stylus to make art. <mark class="four">Everything I've done on this site has been created from the rough glide of a shaky, mouse pointer.</mark>
						Yeah, <i>and?</i> I know. I know. Nobody cares about your early-onsetting arthritis. But as with programming languages, as someone "great" once said, it doesn't matter what tool you use, as long as you achieve the end result. 
						Wait, wait, wait. That sounds like an argument for AI; it's easy, fast, maybe cheap, and it doesn't matter if you don't understand the language. 
						And to that I say, "I guess it's just human to want to do things your own way, even if it's harder."
						<br>
						<br>
						So, what are some disadvantages of using a mouse for art? 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span>For starters, this ain't Ratatouille, and you can't create dynamic thickness with lines from each swipe of the mouse.
						Everything is only thick OR only thin, so to achieve a tapering effect you need to work with vector node points or, as with raster images, you need to be uber skilled with the eraser tool and some clever layering.
						It sounds easy, but that's because growing up I could never afford specialized equipment for digital art, and now that I'm all grown up I just love doing it that way (which is another way of saying the same thing).
						So rather than it being truly hard, <mark class="eight">it merely takes time and patience.</mark> 
						Ya know, those two things all humans dread. 
						And sometimes that patience is rewarded with something mildly pleasing.

						<p class="initialchar">So, with the basic outline of the plot storyboarded out, I continued writing this wall of text.
						<mark class="five">You can see from the figures above, the left image represents the "home" page of this website, where my original idea manifested.</mark>
						The main things to sketch out were: the logo; the font; and with the logo in mind, the weight of text and related lines; and then eventually some sort of color scheme to make things pop.
						<mark class="six">The right image illustrates some evolution in the initial black & white design, featuring animated tabs that would have floated in from the left and right sides as you hovered over article headlines.</mark>
						Now, I thought that would be a cool idea, and you can still see an inkling of that on the homepage, <mark class="seven">but ultimately it wouldn't work well for mobile viewing.</mark>
						Low-pixel-width devices usually incorporate touch screen technology, and personally I find it hard to hover my finger over a button rather than mash it down with my thumb every time.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span>The hardest thing about this whole website, as I write this out and haven't bothered to do it yet, is making it mobile friendly.
						The website is responsive, but as is the modern day calamity of the perfect storm, there are just too many devices out there and every single website and app is broken by one of them, for whatever reason.
						(I'm looking right at you, iPads.) <mark class="four">The center image's horizontal top menu goes some way towards fixing that dilemma</mark> (which you can see depending on the pixel width of your viewing screen), but ultimately it's hit or miss with any given device.
						The good ol' hamburger menu can only go so far. 
						Not everyone likes a good burger. Right, iPatty? Of course, I have no idea since I'm an android person, myself. Oy! "I thought you said there was no AI on this website!?"
						Well, like anything else that won't age well, I could say I'm a Windows 10 person. Ooh, too soon, too soon. RIP October 14th, 2025.
						Anyhow, <mark class="six">media queries are the name of the game, or simply making a completely alternative CSS document specifically for smaller sized screens. 
						I've gone for both,</mark> and my copy paste skills have never been the same since.
						But back to those images.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span><mark class="six">The center image represents my attempt at color theory for the website. </mark>
						With the homepage originally in black & white, the general scheme of <mark class="four">the site deserved some contrastive elements</mark> to draw the eye beyond the heavy, thick lines of the logo.
						Mixing sugar, spice, and everything nice, I accidentally spilled in <i>chemical X,</i> and thus the Roy G. Biv tabs were born! (I'm a parent, so... forgive me.)
						This just so happened to coincide with the number of letters in Ozmosis... one... two... oh, I see what you did there. Yes, <mark class="seven">there are seven colors in Roy G. Biv and seven letters in Ozmosis.</mark>  Can we talk about <i>balance?</i>
						With that serendipitously settled, I went for Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue (swapped for Teal), Indigo (two blues in a rainbow, who knew), and Violet colors that would lean toward pastels, eventually looking fairly similar to highlighter colors (which I only noticed when finally sitting down to write out treatise<i>this,</i> the longest page in Ozmosis history).
						What can I say? <mark class="five">I like how it turned out, and now this "words" page is covered in faux highlighter markings.</mark>
						</p>
						
					<h1 class="chapters chapterthree" id="chapterthree">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
						
						<p class="initialchar">If that wasn't enough, <mark class="ten">I made the rest of the website navigation links reflect those colors, and their resulting pages stayed true to the theme</mark> as well.
						All in all, I'd clap myself on the back if my arms were flexible enough, and call it a day. However, I wasn't quite done with the color scheme. I needed to fill out each page!
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span>I'll be honest. <i>This</i> was the hardest part, since each page would have a different set of text information, images, and resulting layout to manage the different assets and their presentation. 
						Luckily, <mark class="eleven">I found some helpful information online from great sites like Stack Overflow, CSS-Tricks, and Reddit</mark> &mdash; bastions of terrible solutions and genius fixes alike &mdash; but ultimately, whether the code worked or not, it depended on my implementation of it.
						I think the most useful code help I encountered was related to flexboxes and grid organization. Where were those back in the early 2000s? 
						They were not supported by every browser. Thankfully, that's pretty much covered now-a-days, but if you happen to have Internet Explorer on your Windows Vista computer, sorry in advance for how this site looks.
						To everyone else, thank you for using the latest and greatest browser versions.
						</p>
						
						<p class="initialchar">Several things proved challenging after the initial set up of the navigation bar, the grid of the main content, and the footer with some choice self-advertising.
						First, <mark class="nine">I wanted to make the Logos, Photos, and Art page have a nice cascading opacity reveal, one after the other, to give it a waterfall-like feeling. 
						I achieved that effect with nth-child selectors</mark> and a whole lot of copy pasting with minute changes. Talk about tedious. 
						<mark class="eleven">I've kept it that way because it works,</mark> but I know from looking across the interwebs that  there are some solutions in SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) calculation formats that I can replace it with (and I'll get to that at some point).
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span>My personal predisposition would be for more CSS and less Javascript (JS), simply because I come from a long heritage of ad-blockers and dial-up internet where JS loading meant nothing was loading (or risk catching a virus), and I'm sure there are people out there in the world still viewing the JS-disabled internet.
						That said, there's a good mix of CSS animation/transitions and JS scripts to provide a more powerful set of tools to achieve what I wanted. 
						As you may recall from a previous quote in Chapter One, I'm not concerned about what language I use to make this site work, I just care that it works &mdash; without any AI on this site, anyway.
						Ugh. There is some really cool stuff going on in the AI web development space, but as an artist myself, I just can't do it here.
						<mark class="nine">On the Photos page, the quick video clips found there are real</mark> and, along with the photos there, were taken by yours truly without the help of AI.
						Similarly, <mark class="nine">the Art page is devoted to every little swipe of the mouse that made those images come alive, with human effort behind every curve and point.</mark>
						Believe me, there's a lot of cool photo-to-video stuff I could do with my Art page without being too overt, but I'll leave that experimentation to another website (or future me that's caved) where it's appropriate.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="indenthere"></span>In Japanese culture, which I'd be intimately familiar with if not for my surface level of understanding, <mark class="eleven">there's a concept called <i>"wabi-sabi."</i> </mark>
						The principle behind <i>wabi-sabi</i> is <mark class="nine">to find beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness.</mark>
						Now, as bad as that could sound, especially when dealing with frontend web development, it has a nice air to it for the sake of transitions, animations, hovers, and links. 
						<mark class="ten">Like a handmade clay pot you prefer over the machined and uniform porcelain you buy at a store, this bespoke website can be appreciated for its unique aesthetic too. </mark>
						<br>
						<br>
						Well, there you have it. A website is born.

						It took a couple of weeks to build (while in the woods with no internet!), in between parenting, driving, and running errands, but thankfully none of my kids pressed the delete button while I was afk.
						Though I hear stories of AI performing that task too.
						<br>
						<br>
						Oh, and if you didn't notice already, <mark class="eleven">yes, I absolutely made all those drop caps read OZMOSIS.</mark> 
						Someone's gotta restore balance to the semi-permeable force.
						<br>
						<br>
						Anyhow, I hope you enjoy this website as much as I enjoyed making it. 
						<br>
						<br>
						I'll see you on the next page.
